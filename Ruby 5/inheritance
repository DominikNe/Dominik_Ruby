Inheritance is when a class inherits behavior from another class. The class that is inheriting behavior is called the subclass and the class it inherits from is called the superclass.

We use inheritance as a way to extract common behaviors from classes that share that behavior, and move it to a superclass. This lets us keep logic in one place. Let's take a look at an example.
Class Inheritance

Here, we're extracting the speak method to a superclass Animal, and we use inheritance to make that behavior available to GoodDog and Cat classes.

# good_dog_class.rb

class Animal
  def speak
    "Hello!"
  end
end

class GoodDog < Animal
end

class Cat < Animal
end

sparky = GoodDog.new
paws = Cat.new
puts sparky.speak           # => Hello!
puts paws.speak             # => Hello!
