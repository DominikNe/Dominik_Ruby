Class Variables

Class variables are easy. Simply create your new class, use the @@ to denote the variable as class level and add a getter method like so:

class Polygon
  @@sides = 10
  def self.sides
    @@sides
  end
end

puts Polygon.sides # => 10

Instance Variables

Objects can have class and instance variables. This means that a class can have instance variables. Letâ€™s reopen our Polygon class and add an instance variable:

class Polygon
  @sides = 10
end

Now, you can use some reflection to check out Polygonâ€™s class and instance variables:

puts Polygon.class_variables # => @@sides
puts Polygon.instance_variables # => @sides
